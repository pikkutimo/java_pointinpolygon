<h1>Point in Polygon</h1>

Simple Java program that compares coordinate point against a polygon. The program reads the point/points from the file "pisteet.txt" and the polygon from the file "polygoni.txt". The analysis returns an analysis for each point with three distict responses: 

1. if the point is on the line of the polygon
2. if the point is inside the polygon
3. if the point is outside the polygon

The analysis for each point from the "pisteet.txt" is written into "selvitys.txt".

The actual algorithm is from [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328261365_Optimal_Reliable_Point-in-Polygon_Test_and_Differential_Coding_Boolean_Operations_on_Polygons).

The project contains JUnit 5 tests for it.

Finnish was used as the project language.

The impetus for the project was an internship I was applying to.
